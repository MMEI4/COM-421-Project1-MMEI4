    <h1>How to organize and analyze research data</h1>
    <aside class="sidebar">
        <p><strong>For this lesson, you'll need the following:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Microsoft Excel</strong></li>
            <li><strong>PASW (formerly SPSS) statistics software, or free trial download</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>You should already be familiar with:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>The basic functions and tools of Excel</strong></li>
            <li><strong>
                <span class = "dark_blue">Descriptive statistics</span> and 
                <span class = "dark_blue"> inferential statistics</span>
            </strong></li>
            <li><strong>Research design and how to identify <span class = "dark_blue">independent variables</span> and <span class = "dark_blue">dependent variables</span></strong></li>
        </ul>
    </aside>

    <p>This short lesson is intended for graduate and advanced undergraduate students undertaking original research projects. After completing the 30-minute lesson, you will be able to to:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Format raw research data in an Excel spreadsheet for efficient analysis</li>
        <li>Run basic descriptive statistics in Excel</li>
        <li>Prepare the document for statistical analysis in the software package PASW</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Format data for analysis</h2>
    <p>Make sure the computer you are working on has Microsoft Excel installed. Open the document <a href="tutorial_spreadsheet.xlsx" download>ToolBox_DataLesson.xls</a> in Excel and follow along with the lesson, taking action as instructed. In the Raw_Dataset spreadsheet, the name of each variable has been entered in the first row of each column.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Each variable name must be different from other variable names.</li>
        <li>The first variable (in column A) is a <span class = "dark_blue">unique identifier</span></li>
        <li>Variable names must start with a letter (not numbers or special characters), so change <em>4tutorial_types</em> to tutorial_types.</li>
        <li>Name variables so that they are intuitive to you. Therefore, change <em>use</em> and <em>useful</em> to <em>perc_ease_of_use</em> and <em>perc_usefulness</em>, respectively.</li>
        <li>Your spreadsheet should look like Figure 1, and it should now be readily apparent that Column F refers to <em>Perceived Usefulness</em> and Column G refers to <em>Perceived Ease of Use</em>.</li>
    </ol>
