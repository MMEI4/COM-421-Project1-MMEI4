Looking at my project, I say that it is a replica of the documents given for the project. I tried my best to match the headings (sizes), margin levels, and semantics. I have sidebars where they are, I have the elements properly linked (websites and images). 

If I were given more time, I would learn the CSS to put the paragraph in one of the grid-like structures present in the textbook. This would be more so to fill up the white space on the right, but in a vertical format it presents the information neatly too.
Each of the modules could have a navigation of its own because modules like the research one are fairly long and users would benefit from it to find content faster.
